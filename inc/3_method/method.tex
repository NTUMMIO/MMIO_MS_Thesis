The dataset used in this study consisted of T1-weighted \gls{MRI} in native space and corresponding [$^{18}$F]-FDG \gls{PET} data from 50 subjects, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (\url{adni.loni.usc.edu}). These subjects span three diagnostic categories: cognitive normal (\gls{CN}), mild cognitive impairment (\gls{MCI}), and Alzheimer's disease (\gls{AD}), with 17, 16, and 17 subjects respectively.
